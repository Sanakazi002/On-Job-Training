I along with my team members developed this project which aimed to discover insights into road transport and communication of Maharashtra state.
In this project, I have Consolidated and arranged multiple socio-economic tables in excel and found out discrepancies present in the dataset for previous five years.
I have used MS Excel to make visualizations as I was instructed to use majorly MS Excel. 
The dataset consisted of passenger vehicles, good transport vehicles, license holders and fuel type.
I have worked on Analysis on  Number of motor vehicles and license holders in Maharashtra.

My findings are as follows:
In Maharashtra majority of the citizens use petrol vehicles and Pune division is the highest in petrol fuel type followed by konkan division. The highest number of vehicles are in Pune division and in Pune division, Pune district is having significant increasing trend in the total number of vehicles for past 5 years (2018-23).
Passenger vehicles and goods transport vehicles have corrrelation of -0.477 that means they have a slight negative correlation.
I have performed One Way Anova to investigate: Does the passenger vehicles differ significantly by fuel type? 
Firstly, I conducted normality test and found out that the data is not normally distributed so I moved to alternative Nonparametric test for One Way Anova which is Kruskal Walliâ€™s test.
Final conclusion is that the passenger vehicles differ significantly by fuel type. The passenger vehicles differ significantly by the pairs CNG/LPG-Disel, CNG/LPG-Petrol, Disel-Petrol.
I have perfomed outlier detection using boxplot.
Regarding analysis on License holders, Pune division is having maximum number of license holders which is obvious as Pune division is having highest number of total vehicles.
Through this project, i have learnt team work and collaboration , work ethics and leadership. Also learnt to make reports on the findings.
